-To start you will need to clone this repository:  https://github.com/WarmuthMia/OUEvents
-If you are using VS Code, you will need the Live Server extension installed. This will allow you to run your html file on your default browser. (The one by Ritwick Dey is what I use) 

What is what? 
app.py --> The actual starting python code for the application
static --> all extra files such as css, images, etc.
templates --> html file(s)
venv --> holds all the libraries we are using for our application (mostly flask) 

Extra Info
-please don't change the folder names, they are called that so it works seamlessly with Flask. 
-I left brief comments explaining my code, but if you have any questions please let me know as they're not very detailed.
